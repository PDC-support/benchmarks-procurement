HPL
===

Benchmark Purpose
-----------------

Measure the attainable floating-point performance by solving a large, dense
system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting.


Benchmark Results for Submission
--------------------------------

The tenderer is expected to commit to a minimum attained performance as
reported by the HPL benchmark for each of the two modules in isolation.


Run Rules
---------

* The benchmark code and runs must comply with the rules set out for
  submission to the Top500 list of supercomputers
  [https://www.top500.org/project/call_for_participation/].


Source Code
-----------
