Please refer the the appropriate sub-directories for each of the benchmarks.

The tenderer is required to commit to performance for each of the following
benchmarks:

* High-Performance Linpack (HPL)
* STREAM triad
* Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT)
* GPCNet
* IOR
* mdtest

It is permitted (and advised) to replace the standard library calls in
following benchmarks with functions from libraries optimized for the
relevant hardware, in this case the libraries need to be included in
the tender.

* HPL
* STREAM
* FFT

Please see the corresponding subdirectories for more detailed information
on the permitted changes.

Please note that different benchmarks have different requirements and weights
as outlined in the request for tender.
