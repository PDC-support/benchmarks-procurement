The system consist of the EAG1 membrane protein embedded in a lipid bilayer.
The EAG1 ion channel is part of the KCNH family of voltage-gated potassium channels. In
addition to voltage, it is also gated by calmodulin, a small Ca2+-sensing protein.
EAG is a prevalent central nervous system channel, and its malfunction is strongly linked
to cancer propagation which makes it a suitable marker for cancer [1].
This benchmark system consists of approximately 615900 atoms and it is representative of
the larger end of the spectrum of biomolecular simulation systems.

The system is challenging for strong scaling as, strong scaling is critical to achieving
useful performance and,  while the particle interactions can scale to >6-10k) cores, the
3D FFT computation becomes very sensitive to network performance.

The simulation uses 2 fs time step with h-bonds constrained.
